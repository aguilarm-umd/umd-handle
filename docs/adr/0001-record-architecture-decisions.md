# 0001 - Record architecture decisions

Date: April 12, 2021

## Context

Maintaining a record of key decisions made in the project seems worthwhile.

The general idea is to record important decisions that affect the application
as a whole, for the use of future developers and maintainers.

ADRs will be kept in the project repository under the "docs/adr/" directory and
will be named as `<NNNN>-<descriptive-title>` where `<NNNN>` is the document
number, and `<descriptive-title>` is a  short lower-case descriptive title,
with spaces replaced by dashes.

## Decision

See [http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][1]
for general motivation and format for architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Consequences

Recording architecture decisions should reduce the learning curve for new
developers and maintainers coming on the project.

There is a maintenace burden in creating ADRs, but it is expected that this will
be outweighed by the benefits.
